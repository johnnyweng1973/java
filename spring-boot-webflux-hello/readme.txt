Webflux project note 1:
Project hello:
1. Spring boot project file generation
Visit spring initlzr website and you can get a spring project tarfile there.
2. Spring boot project  structure
            src/main/java for java source files, src/test/java for test files
            Target will be generated by build tools to store target files
            Pom.xml in the root
            Main package is in root dir such as com/example/springbootwebfluxhello, this dir should only has one file that is the classname of application.
            Other packages should be subdirs for classes of controller, service, repo, etc.
3. Springbootwebfluxhello project structure
It has three packages: 
      main package: one file with application class annotated with “@SpringBootApplication”
      controller package: one file with controller class annotated with “@RestController”.
       entity package: one file with class for user definition 
4. Controller class
Controller is entry point of handling http request. All methods are annotated with “@GetMapping("/path")”
In this example, it can handle request with synchronous way which return a string directly. And asynchronous way which return a mono<User>. It calls factory method “just”  of Mono to generate an data
       Return Mono.just(User)


5. Json library
As shown above, when you return a Mono<User> to Spring, spring will use json library jackson to serialize this object. It will output name-value pairs for all private fields of this object who has public getter method.

6. annotation
annotation is defined as @interface in java. Spring framework defines a lot of these annotations. Java will add annotations of classes to meta info of a class file and during runtime spring framework will check and decode these meta info.
